is the result of a research project. To support our research, please cite one of our papers instead of referencing our GitHub repository in scientific articles. You can find an overview of papers about FHIRconnect here. If you are unsure which paper to cite, we recommend this one: WIP Thank you! FHIRconnect is a derivative of YAML. It is used to bidirectionally map openEHR and FHIR. The goal is to create a mapping language that communities can use to transform data between these standards. FHIRconnect aims to be both comprehensive and simple to use while providing all necessary functions for mapping. Beyond transformation, the specification and resulting files should also serve as documentation on how these mappings should be performed. Even if vendors do not implement FHIRconnect, they will still have documentation on how data should be transformed. This is particularly important for maintaining consistency when mapping both standards across different institutions. The initial draft of FHIRconnect was done by Better , this version is a major overhaul. The official mapping library of FHIRconnect is maintained here. You can find current issues related to the specification in the repository under the \"Issues\" tab on GitHub. The repository also contains a library of mappings. Currently, these include mappings for KDS, the German core dataset for research, as well as general archetype mappings. Please note that some templates are still being reworked. Additionally, some of the mapped templates contain outdated and low-quality archetypes created for Highmed eight years ago (specifically, the org.highmed archetypes). We are currently in the process of refactoring these. For comments, suggestions, and general discussions, please use the Issues tab on GitHub.

The mapping method that has a condition is only executed if the parts in the condition are true. There are two types of conditions: openehrCondition and fhirCondition, one for each corresponding standard. Examples: - name: \"example\" with: fhir: \"$fhirRoot\" openehr: \"$archetype\" slotArchetype: \"EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.v1\" openehrCondition: targetRoot: \"$archetype\" targetAttribute: \"data[at0001]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.problem_qualifier.v2]/items[at0063]/defining_code/code_string\" operator: \"one of\" criteria: \"at0064\" - name: \"mapIdentifierForRoom\" with: fhir: \"$resource.identifier\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.identifier\" targetAttribute: \"type.coding.code\" operator: \"one of\" criteria: \"room\" Each condition has 4 fields. The targetRoot is the first one. It defines what element is returned once filtered. This is important since the returned element is matched against the path in the with method. If these do not align, FHIRconnect will not be able to filter correctly and the engine should return an error here. - name: \"mapIdentifierForRoom\" with: fhir: \"$resource.identifier\" # same path 0..n openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.identifier\" # same path 0..n In the fhirCondition example, the $resource.identifier is the same in both paths. The condition is applied to each element in the identifier (0..n), and the with method only executes the mapping for those identifiers for which the condition is true. Meanwhile, for the following example, the condition method would try to filter on type, which does not match the element in the with: statement. This would result in an error. - name: \"mapIdentifierForRoom\" with: fhir: \"$resource.identifier\" # same path 0..n openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.identifier.type\" # not the same since references type The targetAttribute is used to specify the path the filter is applied to. The example below in FHIRPath would be written as $resource.identifier.where(type.coding.code=\"room\"), therefore checking for the code type and returning the identifier entries that match. These are the ones that are mapped in the with: method. - name: \"mapIdentifierForRoom\" with: fhir: \"$resource.identifier\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.identifier\" # same except for type targetAttribute: \"type.coding.code\" # access child nodes operator: \"one of\" criteria: \"room\" In the following example, only the encounter-id-1245 would be mapped, since it fits the condition. The bed code would be ignored. \"identifier\": [ { \"use\": \"official\", \"type\": { \"coding\": [ { \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\", \"code\": \"room\" //would be mapped } ] }, \"system\": \"http://hospital.smarthealthit.org\", \"value\": \"encounter-id-1245\" }, { \"use\": \"official\", \"type\": { \"coding\": [ { \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\", \"code\": \"bed\" //wouldn't be mapped } ] }, \"system\": \"http://hospital.smarthealthit.org\", \"value\": \"encounter-id-12asdasdasd45\" } ], It is also important to mention that conditions are always applied on the input data. They do not filter on the data that is currently mapped. When we map a FHIR resource into openEHR, only the fhirConditions are processed and in case of openEHR to FHIR it’s the other way around. So e.g. the openEHRCondition are not applied via mapping-time to the openEHR data being currently mapped. The use of Attributes is also supported, in this case the values need to be written as a yaml list using -. Conditions can also be unattached to the path contained in the with: method and point to a different path. This is sometimes necessary since there can be factors that influence the mapping in other places. These paths are handled as simple true/false and therefore differ in the way they interact with the with: method. - name: \"room\" with: fhir: \"$resource.location.identifier.value\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.some.otherPath\" targetAttribute: \"coding.code\" operator: \"one of\" criteria: \"someValue\" Once the path for the condition is chosen and how it relates (or does not relate) to the with: method is specified, an operator must also be specified. Operators Description one of checks if the path contains one of the elements contained in criteria, uses OR not of checks if the path does not contain one of the elements contained in criteria, uses AND empty checks if the path is empty; does not include a criteria, uses AND not empty checks if the path is not empty; does not include a criteria, uses AND type checks if the element in the path matches the given type in criteria, uses OR Defines the element that is combined with the operator and checked against the path. criteria is not required for empty or not empty. criteria can be either a single element, or as a list (using -). Examples: - name: \"mapIdentifierForRoom\" with: fhir: \"$resource.location.identifier\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.location.identifier\" # same except for type targetAttribute: \"type.coding.code\" # access child nodes operator: \"one of\" criteria: \"room\" - name: \"statusCoded\" with: fhir: \"$resource.verificationStatus.coding\" openehr: \"$archetype/items[at0004]/value/defining_code\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.verificationStatus.coding.code\" targetAttribute: \"value\" operator: \"not of\" criteria: \"entered-in-error\" - name: \"bodySiteText\" with: fhir: \"$resource.bodysite.text\" openehr: \"$archetype/items[at0001]\" #Name of body site fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.bodysite\" targetAttribute: \"coding\" operator: \"empty\" mappings: - name: \"period\" with: fhir: \"$resource.onset.as(Period)\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]\" type: \"NONE\" openehrCondition: targetRoot: \"$archetype/data[at0001]\" targetAttribute: \"items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.lebensphase.v0]\" operator: \"not empty\" # openehrCondition example - name: \"bodySiteCoded\" with: fhir: \"$resource.bodysite\" openehr: \"$archetype/items[at0001]\" #Name of body site openehrCondition: targetRoot: \"$archetype\" targetAttribute: \"items[at0001]\" operator: \"type\" criteria: \"DV_CODED_TEXT\" # fhirCondition example - name: \"bodySiteCoding\" with: fhir: \"$resource\" openehr: \"$archetype\" fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$fhirRoot\" operator: \"type\" criteria: \"CodeableConcept\" There can be more conditions (with AND connectors between them). Notice that the condition is an array. There is a special case where a condition can be contained in the preprocessor of a file. This logic defines that the mapping file is only executed if the given condition is met. There can be only one fhirCondition and/or one openEHRCondition. The Condition filters the amount of $archetype or resources that are to be mapped. Example: preprocessor: fhirCondition: targetRoot: \"$resource.verificationStatus\" targetAttribute: \"coding\" operator: \"not of\" criteria: \"entered-in-error\" mappings: - name: \"period\" with: fhir: \"$resource.onset.as(Period)\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]\" type: \"NONE\" openehrCondition: targetRoot: \"$archetype/data[at0001]\" targetAttribute: \"items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.lebensphase.v0]\" operator: \"not empty\" Here, The openEHR mapping will only be executed if the verificationStatus of the cluster is not entered-in-error.

To facilitate this, FollowedBy was introduced. The FollowedBy mechanism allows to attach mappings to each other, ensuring their execution occurs as the next step after the parent mapping method has been executed. The reason for this is that there are nested paths in FHIR and openEHR. For 0..n root elements, mappings must be executed 0..n times. To execute a mapping for two different child nodes within this path, the with logic is not enough. If we split this into two separate with mappings, they will overwrite each other since both address the same root path. mappings: - name: \"period\" with: fhir: \"$resource.onset.as(Period)\" openehr: \"$archetype\" type: \"NONE\" followedBy: mappings: - name: \"start\" with: fhir: \"start\" openehr: \"data[at0001]/items[at0077]\" - name: \"lebensphaseCluster\" with: fhir: \"$fhirRoot\" openehr: \"data[at0001]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.lebensphase.v0]\" slotArchetype: \"CLUSTER.lebensphase.v0\" Here, the onset is accessed if it is a period (FHIRPath helps us here as a shortcut instead of using fhirCondition) and executes a mapping based on the start time of the period. Additionally, we trigger a slot archetype cluster mapping. Slot archetypes are explained in the next chapter. If it was written as two single with: statements, the cluster mappings would, when converting openEHR to FHIR, overwrite the \"start\" mapping since it maps the same path. mappings: - name: \"start\" with: fhir: \"$resource.onset.as(Period).start\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]items[at0077]\" - name: \"lebensphaseCluster\" with: fhir: \"$resource.onset.as(Period)\" # same path onset, overwrites start openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.lebensphase.v0]\" slotArchetype: \"CLUSTER.lebensphase.v0\" More information about recurrence and cardinality see Recurrence All followedBy mappings start with parent’s path. In the example above, resolved path used for actual mapping of - name: \"start\" would be $resource.onset.as(Period).start. First part being from the parent and the start being from the followedBy mapping. In the same manner, openEHR paths are concatenated.

Typically, this is used to map elements like the composer, etc. - name: \"composer\" with: fhir: \"$resource.performer\" openehr: \"$composition/composer\" $openehrRoot and $fhirRoot are used to access a path from the parent mapping. Mappings in FHIRConnect are top-down and can be nested. Each nested path always accesses the parent path and adds a new child to it. If you want to point to the parent instead of a child, you must use the root variables. Example: - name: \"status\" with: fhir: \"$resource\" openehr: \"$archetype/items[at0073]/value\" manual: - name: \"registered\" fhir: path: \"status\" value: \"registered\" openehrCondition: targetRoot: \"$openehrRoot/defining_code\" # $archetype/items[at0073]/value/defining_code targetAttribute: \"code_string\" operator: \"one of\" criteria: \"at0107\" Sometimes, there is no direct openEHR mapping available. Typically, this happens when another FHIR resource type needs to be created. OpenEHR usually bundles all the information contained in a composition, whereas in FHIR, this information is typically spread across multiple resources. The $reference variable indicates that there is no direct mapping to openEHR. Usually, this is handled in the following method.

For this purpose, FHIRPath and openEHR paths are used. This is also the biggest limitation of these mappings: if a corresponding representation of a path is missing in one of the models, it must be added to the model in FHIR or openEHR. Otherwise, there is no mapping. All mapping files start with the mappings key in their body, which is a list containing a set of named mappings. The mappings: body is followed by mapping methods, each part starting with - name: \"mappingName\". This is called a mapping method, and the children contained underneath are called child methods. mappings: # starts mappings - name: \"dateTime\" # name of the mapping Name of the mappings - name: \"dateTime\" is used also when a mapping is being extended (for overwrite or append, see: Extension methods). It is proposed that camelCase is used when specifying mapping names, otherwise apart from being used when referenced in extension methods, they serve no deeper meaning. Inside these mapping methods, there is always a with: statement that contains fhir and openehr keys. These two keys indicate the paths that are mapped against each other. mappings: # starts mappings - name: \"dateTime\" # name of the mapping with: fhir: \"$resource.onset\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0077]\" In this example, FHIR path onset is mapped to the corresponding openEHR path at0077 (date-time of diagnosis onset). The data types of the mapped fields are automatically resolved by the engine. In this case, it would map an onset into a DV_DATE_TIME. If the engine encounters two data types that are not transformable into each other, mapping will not be executed. Sometimes, mappings do not transform these paths directly, depending on the mapping type used. Specific keywords, explained in the following chapters, do not automatically transform these paths but use them in another way. If no specific keys are used, the default behavior is that these paths are mapped against each other. The general way of processing in FHIRconnect is top down. If two mappings are mapped to the same path with a cardinality of 0..1, the later one in the order will overwrite the first one. Also, when nesting methods, the child methods will always aim on the path of the parent, the idea here is that you iterate down the path of an element and step by step map each of the fields contained. This is explained further in the FollowedBy and Recurrence chapter To execute a mapping method unidirectional the undirectional key can be added to a - name: method. This way the mapping contained is only executed in one direction. The allowed values are either \"openehr→fhir\" or \"fhir→openehr\" This is also true for all the child method contained underneath of this with method. mappings: # starts mappings - name: \"dateTime\" # name of the mapping with: fhir: \"$resource.onset\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0077]\" unidirectional: \"openehr->fhir\"","title":"Body","component":"FHIRconnect","version":"latest","name":"body","url":"/FHIRconnect/latest/basics/body.html","titles":[{"text":"with","hash":"with","id":1},{"text":"Top down processing","hash":"top-down-processing","id":2},{"text":"Undirectional","hash":"undirectional","id":3}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"The header is contained in each FHIRconnect mapping file. It is standardized for both FHIRconnect and OMOCL. There are three different types of mapping files in FHIRconnect. For this header explanation and basic chapter we will focus on the model mappings that map an openEHR-archetype to a FHIR resource. Other types are explained later in the chapter Types of mapping files Here we define which grammar version is used, for FHIRconnect its FHIRconnect. The name is followed by the version of the grammar used seperated by a /. The type defines what type of mapping-file this is it can be either: model, extension or context. grammar: FHIRConnect/v1.0.0 # what grammar and version is used in this file type: model # the type of mapping: model, extension or context The metadata defines the name of the mapping, that is a unique id used to identify the mapping and reference it. The version represents which version of the mapping. Different versions can coexist, as sometimes its necessary to maintain several versions. grammar: FHIRConnect/v1.0.0 # what grammar and version is used in this file type: model # the type of mapping: model, extension or context metadata: name: ACTION.informed_consent.v0 #the name of the mapping version: 0.0.1-alpha # version of this particular mapping This defines what standard is mapped by the file, in our case FHIR and which Release of it.

The openEHRCondig.revision states what revision of the archetype this mapping applies for. The fhirConfig.structureDefintion contains the information about which FHIR StructureDefinition is mapped. This is just information for the user and has no impact on the mapping. Naming conventions are as follows: Names of model mappings always start with the type of openEHR class (e.g., EVALUATION) and the full name and version. It can happen that two resources are transformed into one archetype. In this case, the name of the mapping is to be extended with what FHIR type is mapped to what openEHR archetype: CLUSTER.medication.v2 (this maps medication-to-medication) CLUSTER.medication.v2.substance-to-medication (this does not map a FHIR medication but an FHIR substance) This allows for separately calling these archetype mappings for different use cases. The initial one created always stays as CLUSTER.medication.v2 and is to be seen as the default. All future mappings created that also map to medication but from another FHIR input must add a string to their name as described above. We deem the first mapping as the default one. This will prevent dependency problems by renaming the file later on. For extension and context mapping names, there is no specific style guide, as this is a project-specific decision users have to make.","title":"Header","component":"FHIRconnect","version":"latest","name":"main","url":"/FHIRconnect/latest/basics/main.html","titles":[{"text":"Grammar and Type","hash":"grammar-and-type","id":1},{"text":"Metadata","hash":"metadata","id":2},{"text":"Spec","hash":"spec","id":3},{"text":"Naming convention","hash":"naming-convention","id":4}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Given the sequencing pattern to follow a path in FHIRconnect, sometimes it is necessary to access elements back in the path.

The same logic is used in FHIR with ^, which was adapted from JSONPath Plus. Both notations can be combined to access parents further back in the hierarchy.

The EHR domain contains clinical EHR data, while the demographics domain usually contains non-clinical data. The initial idea behind this separation was to address privacy concerns. What constitutes non-clinical data varies between vendors and use cases. In the EHR domain, everything relates to a patient’s EHR, whereas the demographics (or non-clinical CDR) usually contains patient demographic data such as full name, address, insurance number, etc. There are cases where EHR archetypes contain patient-related data, particularly in research contexts. For example, birthdate, gender, and sex are stored. Vendors typically manage demographic data using either a FHIR server or an openEHR demographics server (based on openEHR demographics archetypes). The reference model of the EHR links these external IDs. FHIRconnect logic sends individual FHIR resources to a demographics endpoint and links them accordingly. This endpoint, located outside FHIRconnect, can either transform these resources or use FHIR directly. The key requirement is that it returns an external identifier, which is then linked in the openEHR files and also can be used to re-retrieve the fhir resource for tranforming it back. This process involves mapping resources to RM paths that reference demographic data. If the referenced resource is included in the Bundle, it is sent to the demographics service, and the returned ID is stored in the PARTY_IDENTIFIED (or DV_IDENTIFIER) field. Otherwise, the resource’s identifier is directly linked inside the RM field, since there is nothing to transform.

FHIR requires that resource IDs must be unique within a FHIR server. This creates several challenges. The FHIRconnect engine must: 1. Maintain these IDs to ensure that the same ID is returned when mapping a FHIR resource multiple times. 2. Resolve an external ID to the same internally maintained ID. It cannot simply copy external IDs, as this could lead to unique identifier conflicts (e.g., two different sources might send the same ID). Thus, the engine must implement its own ID management. As an example, this issue could otherwise cause a conflict: Keeping the external ID has advantages: - It allows the engine to process a PUT request. - It enables the engine to retrieve already mapped Compositions by resolving the ID, instead of creating duplicates. This can be achieved by maintaining a table that tracks mapped resources, including their input. Here is a possible pseudocode representation: URL of sending site External Resource ID Internal Resource ID Composition ID http://someFHirServer.com List of resource IDs in the Bundle Corresponding list of internal IDs in the FHIRconnect engine 12312-123123 Be aware that if a site sends the same Bundle twice but omits a resource that was included in a previous version, it will be treated as a different mapping. This could lead to missing references or other inconsistencies, as the list of IDs is always matched against each other. When exporting openEHR data to FHIR, the resource IDs in the Bundle must remain consistent. If the input was not previously provided in FHIR, the system must generate a deterministic ID. Every time we export a Composition into FHIR, the resource IDs must remain the same. To ensure deterministic IDs, we recommend generating an ID based on a hash of the Composition UID and the Entry Path.

FHIR has the problem that each initiative adds new fields in different ways. In FHIR, this is done by adding extensions, and fields are often used differently. A recent publication shows that 35% of the fields contained in an implementation guide are extensions. When converting back and forth between FHIR datasets, these fields can either be missing on one side or provided in another profile, or they may be modeled differently. This makes the transformation between FHIR initiatives difficult, as the integration process has to deal with different representations and missing data that was not modeled. When using FHIR for persistence this 35% results in an integration problem. In this example there is no profile that contain both extensions and regularity. So, for integrating between FHIR profiles, a new profile that captures all three fields would need to be modeled. This profile would then be extended for each new field introduced by a each FHIR initiative. If these fields are modeled differently between initiatives, it results in even more integration processes. There are other problems like differences between releases (FHIR has 6 versions as of now) and missing standardization of composer, etc. pp. See the fiveWs page for an analysis on the semantics of different resource attributes. FHIRconnect solves this issue. The mappings defined from openEHR-to-FHIR are based on archetypes and map using extensions into a profile. Therefore, the data contained in openEHR does not need to be stored in e.g. a new template. Here, two different templates populate different fields of the same archetype. The mapping is executed from openEHR-to-FHIR based on the archetype. The extension mapping may change how some paths of the archetype are mapped to Profile 1 or Profile 2, but this is independent of the template and relates to the profile. Therefore, once we write a mapping for Profile 1, each archetype in an openEHR CDR can be mapped to that specific profile (if no mandatory field is missing). The downside here is that FHIR initiatives are modeled in smaller scopes for exchange purposes, and parts of the data contained in archetypes definition are often not modeled in the FHIR profiles, leading to data loss. In regard to FHIR releases, currently FHIRconnect was designed to map R4. Adapting other releases like R5 could only require editing the paths of the mappings files and marking them with R5 in the header. This has not been reviewed extensively, so problems may arise. This provides the possibility to convert data between different FHIR projects in an easy manner by using openEHR as a cannonical model, e.g. transforming data from the german-core dataset (KDS) to the EEHRxF FHIR-profiles and back. For mapping FHIR-to-openEHR, the template used can be seen as an ingest for the FHIR profile. FHIR profiles are mostly designed for exchange and not for recording clinical data inside institutions. Therefore, a split between data-capture and FHIR templates is sometimes recommended to avoid infringing on the primary data-capture templates. Hereby, the mandatory fields (1..1) should be contained otherwise the mapping can not be executed. Yet, it is not always mandatory.","title":"Template Agnostic","component":"FHIRconnect","version":"latest","name":"TemplateAgnostic","url":"/FHIRconnect/latest/types-of-mapping-files/TemplateAgnostic.html","titles":[{"text":"FHIR mappings and the persistence problem","hash":"fhir-mappings-and-the-persistence-problem","id":1},{"text":"How agnostic archetype mappings solve this issue","hash":"how-agnostic-archetype-mappings-solve-this-issue","id":2},{"text":"Modeling recommendation","hash":"modeling-recommendation","id":3}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"Composition mappings are not an own layer of mapping.

These extensions are fields that are typically introduced by the user, since the resource does not cover every use case. Also profiles, depending on the project, can make use of fields in a different way. OpenEHR on the other hand, has templates, these reference archetypes as building blocks and constrain them or add coding values etc. They do not extend the existing models, only constraint archetypes or the reference model. Both Templates and Profiles are designed to be project specific. Therefore, for each project that is mapped, we need to introduce a set of changes and extensions to our model-mappings. This is done in the extension mappings. An extension mapping always relates 1-to-1 to a model-mapping. In general the folder structure of each FHIRconnect project is up to the provider. The official library follows the pattern described here. Extension mappings are contained in the project folder. Folders are split depending on the project files they contain. Inside the project folder, sub-folders represent each module that is mapped. These folders contain the extensions and context-files for one template (sometimes also more than for one template) .

The model mapping header was already introduced in the first chapter under Header. engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1 # Specifies the grammar and version used in this file type: model # The type of mapping: model, extension, or context metadata: name: ACTION.informed_consent.v0 # The name of the mapping version: 1.0.0 # The version of this particular mapping spec: # Schema specific to the FHIRConnect v0.0.1 engine system: FHIR # Specifies what is being mapped version: R4 openEhrConfig: archetype: ACTION.informed_consent.v0 # The openEHR archetype being mapped in this model mapping fhirConfig: structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Consent # The FHIR StructureDefinition to which this is mapped In general the folder structure of each FHIRconnect project is up to the provider. The official library follows the pattern described here. Each of these model mappings aims to be as generically valid as possible. They can be found in the mapping/model folder. Here, the models are organized based on their openEHR archetype type. OpenEHR has several model libraries, being the international CKM the most important one. This contains the international models used by openEHR platforms. Model mappings for these can be found under the folder org.openehr, which indicates the namespace of an archetype. Sometimes, local models are created to meet national requirements. For example, the models from HiGHmed are located under org.highmed. Inside these folders, the model mappings are stored. Occasionally, there will be more than one model mapping for the same archetype that differ in their FHIR output. For example, the dosage archetype has two mappings: one for dosage-to-dosage and another for dosage-to-backboneElement. The dosage-to-dosage mapping is treated as the default, so its name is simply dosage.v2. This naming convention was chosen because the dosage-to-dosage mapping is naturally more comprehensive compared to the backboneElement mapping. For processing, these files are called by their metadata.name, making them distinguishable. The name of a model mapping file always starts with the name of the archetype (excluding the openEHR-EHR-TYPE). To illustrate the explained methods, here is an example of a mapping between the problem_diagnosis archetype and the FHIR Condition resource. engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1 type: model metadata: name: EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.v1 version: 0.0.1-alpha spec: system: FHIR version: R4 openEhrConfig: archetype: openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.v1 fhirConfig: structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Condition mappings: - name: \"contextStartTime\" with: fhir: \"$resource.recordedDate\" openehr: \"$composition/context/start_time\" - name: \"participations\" with: fhir: \"$resource.asserter\" openehr: \"$composition/context/participations\" participationsFunction: \"asserter\" - name: \"composer\" with: fhir: \"$resource.recorder\" openehr: \"$composition/composer\" - name: \"other_participations\" with: fhir: \"$resource.asserter\" openehr: \"$archetype/other_participations\" participationsFunction: \"asserter\" - name: \"provider\" with: fhir: \"$resource.recorder\" openehr: \"$archetype/provider\" # Often required, so the simplified mapping engine resolves Reference -> Participations - name: \"problemDiagnose\" with: fhir: \"$resource.code\" openehr: \"$archetype\" type: \"NONE\" followedBy: mappings: - name: \"problemDiagnoseName\" with: fhir: \"coding\" openehr: \"data[at0001]/items[at0002]\" - name: \"problemDiagnoseText\" with: fhir: \"text\" openehr: \"data[at0001]/items[at0009]\" - name: \"note\" with: fhir: \"$resource.note.text\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0069]\" - name: \"dateTime\" with: fhir: \"$resource.onset\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0077]\" - name: \"bodySite\" with: fhir: \"$resource.bodySite\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0012]\" - name: \"bodySiteCluster\" with: fhir: \"$resource\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.anatomical_location.v1]\" slotArchetype: \"CLUSTER.anatomical_location.v1\" - name: \"severity\" with: fhir: \"$resource.severity\" openehr: \"$archetype/data[at0005]\" Since model mappings should include all archetype to resource mappings, these will contain some mappings that are not part of the corresponding Profile/Templates, as they have (0..0) occurrences.

Sometimes, the hierarchy between a FHIR and an openEHR model does not align properly. For example, elements may exist on different levels in the models, leading to complications. The hierarchy mapping is always contained in the preprocessor using the hierarchy key. There can be only one hierarchy mapping; currently, we have not encountered a case where more than one is needed. The simplest hierarchy mapping is related to events in openEHR. OBSERVATION archetypes in openEHR can contain a list of events. In FHIR, these events are sometimes represented by a resource for each one. Therefore, for each event in openEHR, one resource must be created. The with: key indicates which paths are to be accessed and iterated if they are 0..n. The split key can contain either openEHR or fhir. The create method defines the element to create. In the case of a resource or archetype, this type is inferred by the FHIRconnect mapping file it is included in. The create method is executed for each occurrence of the correlating with statement. As an example: openEhrConfig: archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result.v1 revision: 1.2.5 fhirConfig: structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport preprocessor: hierarchy: with: fhir: \"$resource\" openEHR: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]\" split: fhir: create: \"resource\" For each occurrence of $archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002], the split is executed. Each occurrence of an event (if there is more than one) will create a new DiagnosticReport. The engine’s composition fields remain the same for each of these mappings. One could imagine this process as cloning the composition with one event each, making the processing 1-to-1. Another case for hierarchy mappings is creating a new element based on a specific filter. A good example of this is the FHIR MedicationStatement. Without delving into the details of why the models are structured differently, there are several challenges to address. In FHIR, the timing.event contained within the dosage element (see MedicationStatement) maps to the time of the EVENT in openEHR. Therefore, if there are three dosages in FHIR with different timing.event values, three separate EVENT elements must be created in the openEHR medication_statement archetype. Another issue is the route of administration. In openEHR, the route of administration is contained in each medication_statement EVENT. However, in FHIR, this is part of the dosage element. A single MedicationStatement in FHIR can have three different dosages, each with a different route of administration. For each unique route of administration, a new medication_statement EVENT must be created in openEHR. The same logic applies when mapping from openEHR to FHIR. In openEHR, each EVENT can contain a different medication, whereas in FHIR, each MedicationStatement resource can only describe one medication. So for each openEHR EVENT containing a different medication, a new resource needs to be created. The grammar enables this with the path and unique keys. To recap, the create: key specifies the type of element to be created. The path: key indicates where this element should be created. This is left empty if the element is the archetype or resource itself, as in the example shown at fhir:. The unique: key defines the condition that triggers the creation of the new element. The path in the unique: key relates to the with: method. For example, in the example, we want to split the data transformation based on dosages, so the with: path relates to dosage. This will not automatically transform the dosage and event as a normal with: would do. It is rather used as an indicator, as explained above. preprocessor: hierarchy: with: fhir: \"$resource.dosage\" openEHR: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]\" # type: \"HIERARCHY\" # Not necessary since hierarchy is a unique key for hierarchy mappings split: fhir: create: \"resource\" unique: - \"data[at0003]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.medication.v2]/items[at0132]\" openEHR: create: \"event\" path: \"$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]\" unique: - \"route\" - \"timing.event\" # If the route value differs per dosage slice, create a new event To summarize: From FHIR-to-openEHR, for each dosage with a different route and/or timing.event, create a new EVENT in openEHR. From openEHR-to-FHIR, for each event in openEHR with a different medication name ([at0132]), create a new MedicationStatement resource in FHIR.","title":"Hierarchy Mappings","component":"FHIRconnect","version":"latest","name":"HierarchyMappings","url":"/FHIRconnect/latest/types-of-mappings/concept-type/HierarchyMappings.html","titles":[{"text":"split","hash":"split","id":1},{"text":"Hierarchy and unique values","hash":"hierarchy-and-unique-values","id":2}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"FHIR-based data typically contains a great number of references. Resources are small building blocks that reference each other to provide a comprehensive view of the patient information. The reference: logic was introduced to support this. It allows us to initialize a new resource in FHIR (or the other way around) and reference it inside the resource we are currently mapping. This is accomplished by the reference: keyword, followed by the type of resource we want to initialize in the resourceType attribute. The remaininge mapping follows the usual syntax. The openEHR key is always set with openEHR: $reference, since it is a resource initialization and no direct path mapping.

There are two types of data in openEHR: clinical data and operational data (non-clinical data). openEHR splits this data into demographics for operational data and EHR for clinical data. Given the delicate nature of resolving references, this chapter is a recommendation If a reference that we map pertains to clinical data and is not contained in the composition but appears in another template, a linked mapping should be used. This can be either: Containing some of the information but not all of it. No field provided as part of the archetype. Both cases are relevant to ensure that back transformation into FHIR remains as close as possible. Typically, the important entry of a dataset is usually contained within the reference. For example, in breast cancer treatment, the diagnosis code is referenced as a reason, but the full diagnosis itself is not included. In FHIR, this would be represented as a link to the diagnosis. In openEHR, it is usually stored as part of the encounter or episode-of-care for breast cancer. In this case, the diagnosis should be mapped to the reason. Additionally, a linked mapping should be attached to map the diagnosis generally. Links only function if a corresponding profile or template mapping is available. This ensures that the reason is resolved while maintaining the linkage to the full diagnosis, making back transformation into FHIR easier. Example Mapping - name: \"reason\" extension: \"add\" with: fhir: \"$resource.diagnosis.reference\" openehr: \"$reference\" reference: #type None resourceType: \"Condition\" mappings: - name: \"condition\" with: fhir: \"$fhirRoot.code\" openehr: \"$archetype/item[at0021]\" # reason - name: \"conditionMapping\" with: fhir: \"$fhirRoot\" openehr: \"$openehrRoot/links\" openehrLink: meaning: \"the diagnosis of the reason\" type: \"diagnosis\" If the template does not contain a node pointing to the referenced resource, a link should be created in the composition to maintain the reference and enable back transformation. Links only function if a corresponding profile or template mapping is available. This ensures that the reason is resolved while linking the full diagnosis, making back transformation into FHIR more straightforward. Example Mapping - name: \"reason\" extension: \"add\" with: fhir: \"$resource.diagnosis.reference\" openehr: \"$composition\" reference: #type None resourceType: \"Condition\" mappings: - name: \"conditionMapping\" with: fhir: \"$fhirRoot\" openehr: \"$composition/links\" openehrLink: meaning: \"the diagnosis linked to this composition\" type: \"diagnosis\" This works because references in the LOCATABLE class are a list.

The spec covers all types of mappings, also those who fit partly. To determine which types match we recommend reading the specification anyhow, since the amount of fields mappable between two data-types determine how good these match. If there is consensus, this can be also added to the spec as recommendations. Mappings between two data values are executed depending on the data type of the element. As an example if a period is provided FHIRconnect maps this period to an interval in the corresponding path in openEHR, if it’s a valid data type. If no valid data-type is provided these could be transformed into another element e.g. the period start into a DV_DATE_TIME. This is up to providers how strict or relaxed they want to design their engine. This also includes some of the abstract types if they correlate to a FHIR data-type. There is also some mappings from the Common Information Model contained like a PARTY_IDENTIFIED mapping. Primitive mappings like integers to integers, strings to string etc. are left out due to being straight forward. If a section exists (like for String) these addresses more complex matters and not the basic string-to-string mapping.
