= Transforming child elements in a list
:navtitle: Transforming child elements in a list

To map two lists against each other that contain a set of child items we need to iterate
both of these lists. When iterating each of their appearances each of the corresponding
paths need to be mapped.

== Example
[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "collection"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.collection" # 0..n
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]" # 0..n
      type: "NONE"
    followedBy:
      mappings:
        - name: "collected"
          with:
            fhir: "collected"
            openehr: "items[at0015]"

        - name: "collector"
          with:
            fhir: "collector"
            openehr: "items[at0070]"
----

In the pseudocode example above, both `collection` and `$archetype/data[at0001]` are recurring
elements. Therefore, they are specified on the same level in the mapping. All mappings of a specific
occurrence of `collection` are within `followedBy`, each of which maps in the `followedBy` the elements
of the cluster.
Therefore, these lists would be transformed into each other.

[source,json]
----
  "collection": [
    {
      "collected": "12:00",
      "collector": "13"
    },
    {
      "collected": "13:00",
      "collector": "14"
    }
  ]
----

to

[source,json]
----
  "at0001": [
    {
      "at0015": "12:00",
      "at0070": "13"
    },
    {
      "at0015": "13:00",
      "at0070": "14"
    }
  ]
----

=== Wrong mapping
In this example, the `data[0001]`, which has a cardinality of `0..n`, is contained
as part of the parent mapping paths. FHIRconnect always appends to a `0..n` path if it's
not iterated. The below example would append a new entry in `data[0001]` for each
occurrence of `collection`.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "collection"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.collection" # 0..n
      openehr: "$archetype"
      type: "NONE"
    followedBy:
      mappings:
        - name: "collected"
          with:
            fhir: "collected"
            openehr: "data[at0001]/items[at0015]"

        - name: "collector"
          with:
            fhir: "collector"
            openehr: "data[at0001]/items[at0070]"
----

[source,json]
----
  "collection": [
    {
      "collected": "12:00",
      "collector": "13"
    },
    {
      "collected": "13:00",
      "collector": "14"
    }
  ]
----

would result in this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "at0001": [
    {
      "at0015": "12:00"
    },
    {
      "at0070": "13"
    },
    {
      "at0015": "13:00"
    },
    {
      "at0070": "14"
    }
  ]
}
----

== Example with Slot
In this example, both `ServiceRequest.specimen` as well
as `$archetype/activities[at0001]/description[at0009]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.specimen.v1]` are recurring
elements, therefore they are specified on the same level in the mapping. All mappings of a specific
occurrence of `specimen` are within `followedBy`. For each specimen, one cluster is created.
Each of which maps in the `followedBy` the `identifier`.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "specimen"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.specimen" #0..n
      openehr: "$reference"
      type: "NONE"
    reference:
      resourceType: "Specimen"
      mappings:
        - name: "specimenRecurring"
          with:
            fhir: "$fhirRoot"
            openehr: "$archetype/activities[at0001]
/description[at0009]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.specimen.v1]"   #0..n
          slotArchetype: "CLUSTER.specimen.v1"
          followedBy:
            mappings:
              - name: "specimenIdentifier"
                with:
                  fhir: "identifier"
                  openehr: "items[at0001]"
----

=== Incorrect Mapping

If, on the contrary, this would create two `specimen` clustersâ€”one with the slot and one with only an
identifier.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "specimen"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.specimen"
      openehr: "$reference"
      type: "NONE"
    reference:
      resourceType: "Specimen"
      mappings:
        - name: "specimenRecurring"
          with:
            fhir: "$fhirRoot"
            openehr: "$archetype/activities[at0001]/description[at0009]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.specimen.v1]"
          slotArchetype: "CLUSTER.specimen.v1"
        - name: "specimenIdentifier"
          with:
            fhir: "identifier"
            openehr: "$archetype/activities[at0001]/description[at0009]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.specimen.v1]/items[at0001]"
----

== Example of double nesting
Imagine the following example. We have a `category` in FHIR with `0..n` elements, and this
category has `0..n` text elements. The same goes in openEHR, where you have one `at0094` in the protocol with
`0..n` `at0063` codes. Mapping that correctly would mean matching the corresponding paths
like this:

[source,yaml]
----
mappings:
  - name: "category"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.category" # 0..n
      openehr: "$archetype/protocol[at0004]/items[at0094]" # 0..n
    followedBy:
      - name: "category"
        with:
          fhir: "text" # 0..n
          openehr: "/items[at0063]" # 0..n
----

[source,json]
----
  "category": [
    {
      "text": [
        "1",
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "text": [
        "3",
        "4"
      ]
    }
  ]
----

would result in this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "at0094": [
    {
      "at0063": ["1", "2"]
    },
    {
      "at0063": ["3", "4"]
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Incorrect Mapping

This mapping would iterate one time through all the `text` contained, resulting in
four entries of text being mapped into openEHR. These entries are now mapped to a path
with two `0..n`, since we always append to `0..n`, this would resolve in 4 single entries
inside `at0094`. This would be the same case when mapping from openEHR to FHIR.

[source,yaml]
----
mappings:
  - name: "category"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.category.text" # 0..n
      openehr: "$archetype/protocol[at0004]/items[at0094]/items[at0063]"
----

[source,json]
----
  "category": [
    {
      "text": [
        "1",
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "text": [
        "3",
        "4"
      ]
    }
  ]
----

would result in this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "at0094": [
    {
      "at0063": ["1"]
    },
    {
      "at0063": ["2"]
    },
    {
      "at0063": ["3"]
    },
    {
      "at0063": ["4"]
    }
  ]
}
