= Recurrence

FHIRconnect complexity lies in dealing with recurrence resulting from he different cardinalities contained
in the models. When mapping recurring elements, it is crucial to align both FHIR and openEHR data types
at the same level. Otherwise, recurring elements may not function correctly, leading to
data overwriting instead of properly mapping all occurrences.

There are three types of how recurrences are dealt with.

1. Overwriting a path
2. Populating an child of an `0..n` element
3. Appending to a `0..n`

These are explained in the following chapters.
