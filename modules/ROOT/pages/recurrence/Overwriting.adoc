= Overwriting

Overwrites happen if we write twice in a path that is `0..1`. Sometimes this is done, because an e.g. archetype
could have two paths for one in FHIR. Here we have to choose which one we prefer.
As an example:

[source,yaml]
----
mappings: # starts mappings
  - name: "dateTime" # name of the mapping
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.onset" # 0..1
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0077]" # 0..1

  - name: "muchCoolerDateTime" # overwrites at0077
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.onset" # 0..1
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0078]" # 0..1
----
Here both elements map the onset. If the `at0078` exists in the archetype, we would rather have
this one populated, instead of the `at0077`. Therfore, we write the latter one afterwards.
It will overwrite the first one, since it adresses the same path. When mapping back also `at0078` will
be populated to the onset.

Result:
----
onset: "12:00"
----
----
at0078: "12:00"
----
