= Template Agnostic
:navtitle: Template Agnostic


One of the major advantages, besides being able to reuse model mappings, is that the transformation
of openEHR-to-FHIR is template agnostic.
FHIR has the problem that each initiative adds new fields in different ways.
In FHIR, this is done by adding extensions, and fields are often used differently.
A recent https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37128432/[publication] shows that 35% of the fields
contained in an implementation guide are extensions.
When converting back and forth between FHIR datasets, these fields can either be missing on
one side or provided in another profile, or they may be modeled differently.
This makes the transformation between FHIR initiatives lackluster, as an integration process has to deal with different representations and missing data that was not modeled.

== FHIR mappings and the persistence problem

When using FHIR for persistence this 35% results in an integration problem.

In this example there is no profile that contain both extensions and regularity. So, for integrating
between FHIR profiles, a new profile that captures all three fields would need to be modeled.
This profile would then be extended for each new field introduced by a each FHIR initiative.
If these fields are modeled differently between initiatives, it results in even more integration processes.
There are other problems like the releases (FHIR has 6 versions as of now)
and missing standardization of composer, etc. pp.

== How agnostic archetype mappings solve this issue
FHIRconnect solves this issue.
The mappings defined from openEHR-to-FHIR are based on archetypes and map using extensions into a profile.
Therefore, the data contained in openEHR does not need to be stored in e.g. a new template.

Here, two different templates populate different fields of the same archetype.
The mapping is executed from openEHR-to-FHIR based on the archetype.
The extension mapping may change how some paths of the archetype are mapped to Profile 1 or Profile 2,
but this is independent of the template and relates to the profile.
Therefore, once we write a mapping for Profile 1, each archetype in an openEHR CDR can be mapped
to that specific profile (if no mandatory field is missing).
The downside here is that FHIR initiatives are modeled in smaller scopes for exchange, and the data
contained in archetypes is often not modeled, leading to data loss.

In regard to FHIR releases, currently FHIRconnect was designed to map R4.
Adapting other releases like R6 could only require editing the paths of the mappings files
and marking them with R6 in the header. Yet, it was not reviewed.

This provides the possibility to convert data between different FHIR projects in an easy manner, e.g. transforming
data from the german-core dataset (KDS) to the EEHRxF FHIR-profiles and back.

== Modeling recommendation

For mapping FHIR-to-openEHR, the template used can be seen as an ingest for the FHIR profile.
FHIR profiles are mostly designed for exchange and not for recording clinical data inside institutions.
Therefore, a split between data-capture and FHIR templates is sometimes recommended to
avoid infringing on the primary data-capture templates.
Hereby, it is important that the 1..1 fields are contained otherwise the mapping cannot be executed.
Yet, it is not always mandatory.
