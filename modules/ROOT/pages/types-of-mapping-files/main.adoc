== File structure

Mappings are organized into three types of files. The model mapping is the vanilla
mapping that describes the transformation between an archetype and an un-profiled resource.
This is the most basic form of mapping that is to be shared and maintained by the communities.

Extension mappings are used to extend model mappings by adding, overwriting, or
appending mapping logic to the vanilla model mappings. This is required to map
between templates and profiles. The model mappings act as a sustainable set of base
mappings that can be extended for a given scope using extension mappings. Mappings are additive,
extension mappings can be interpreted as being executed after the model mappings.

Context mappings define the import of model mappings and extension mappings,
specifying what profile is transformed into which template and with which mapping
file to start. There is one context file required for each profile and template mapped.
From a developer's perspective, they act as an import and main.
