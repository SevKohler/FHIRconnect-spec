= The extension mappings
:navtitle: Extension mappings

Archetypes and resources are the core components of he models, but not the only ones. Both openEHR and FHIR
have a second layer of models that interact with these. In FHIR the Profile changes the cardinality of fields,
but also can add extensions. These extensions are fields are typically introduced by the user, since the resource
does not cover everything. Also profiles, depending on the project, can make use of fields in a different way.

OpenEHR on the other hand, has templates, these reference archetypes as building blocks and constrain them or
add coding values etc. They do not extend the existing models.

Both Templates and Profiles are done project specific. Therefore, for each project that is mapped, we need to
introduce a set of alterations and extensions to our model-mappings. This is done in the `extension` mappings.
An extension mapping always relates 1-to-1 to a model-mapping.

== File structure
In general the folder structure of each  FHIRconnect project is up to the vendor.
The official https://github.com/SevKohler/FHIRconnect-mapping-lib/tree/main[library] follows
the pattern described here. Extension mappings are contained in the project folder.
Here the folders are split depending on the project files they contain.

Inside the project folder, sub-folders represent each module that is mapped. These
folders contain the extensions and context-files for one template (sometimes also more than for one template) .
The context file is explained later in the chapter xref:types-of-mapping-files/context-mappings.adoc[].

== Extension header

The `type` of header needs to be set to `extension`. Since it extends a existing mapping it does not need
to reference the archetype etc. pp. again. The key `extends` is used to reference the model-mapping. Hereby,
the name of the model-mapping is used.
