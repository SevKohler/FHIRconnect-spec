= Model Mappings
:navtitle: Model Mappings

The first layer of mappings are the model mappings.
These serve as a reusable base for FHIR-to-openEHR mappings and form the core of FHIRconnect.
Each of these mappings connects either a FHIR
https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/domainresource.html[DomainResource] or
a https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/backboneelement.html[BackboneElement] to an openEHR archetype.

FHIRConnect is designed with the vision of creating a generically valid library of archetype-to-FHIR
mappings. This library is the core strength of FHIRconnect. The goal is for this library to be
maintained by the community, with everyone contributing their basic mappings, correcting existing ones,
and adding new ones. In this way, the library will grow over time, containing an ever-increasing
number of refined archetype mappings.

== Header
The model mapping header was already introduced in the first chapter under xref:basics/main.adoc[].

[source,yaml]
----
engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1  # Specifies the grammar and version used in this file
type: model  # The type of mapping: model, extension, or context
metadata:
  name: ACTION.informed_consent.v0  # The name of the mapping
  version: 1.0.0  # The version of this particular mapping
spec:  # Schema specific to the FHIRConnect v0.0.1 engine
  system: FHIR  # Specifies what is being mapped
  version: R4
  openEhrConfig:
    archetype: ACTION.informed_consent.v0  # The openEHR archetype being mapped in this model mapping
  fhirConfig:
    structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Consent  # The FHIR StructureDefinition to which this is mapped
----

== Folders and Namespaces
In general the folder structure of each FHIRconnect project is up to the provider. The official https://github.com/SevKohler/FHIRconnect-mapping-lib/tree/main[library] follows
the pattern described here. Each of these model mappings aims to be as generically valid as possible. They can be found in
the `mapping/model` folder. Here, the models are organized based on their openEHR archetype type.

image::ModelFolder.png[]

OpenEHR has several model libraries, being the https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/[international CKM] the most
important one. This contains the international models used by openEHR platforms. Model mappings for 
these can be found under the folder `org.openehr`, which indicates the namespace of an archetype. 
Sometimes, local models are created to meet national requirements. For example, the models
from https://ckm.highmed.org/ckm/[HiGHmed] are located under `org.highmed`.

image::ModelFolder2.png[]

Inside these folders, the model mappings are stored.
Occasionally, there will be more than one model mapping for the same archetype that differ in their FHIR output.
For example, the dosage archetype has two mappings: one for dosage-to-dosage and another for
dosage-to-backboneElement. The dosage-to-dosage mapping is treated as the default, so its name is
simply `dosage.v2`.

image::DifferentDosage.png[]

This naming convention was chosen because the dosage-to-dosage mapping is naturally more
comprehensive compared to the backboneElement mapping. For processing, these files are called by
their `metadata.name`, making them distinguishable. The name of a model mapping file always starts
with the name of the archetype (excluding the `openEHR-EHR-TYPE`).

== Model Mapping Examples

To illustrate the explained methods, here is an example of a mapping between the `problem_diagnosis`
archetype and the FHIR `Condition` resource.

== Mapping 0..0 fields

Since model mappings should include all archetype to resource mappings, these will contain
some mappings that are not part of the corresponding Profile/Templates, as they have (0..0) occurrences.
These are ignored and not executed.
