:navtitle: FHIRsearch and AQL

The current version of the specification does not focus specifically on AQL and FHIRsearch.

In general, the FHIRconnect mapping files contain all the logic needed to transform between paths.
This logic must be extracted from the engine to enable searching on openEHR data or vice versa.

One possible approach is mapping AQL to FHIRPath, or alternatively, keeping FHIR data available for search.
