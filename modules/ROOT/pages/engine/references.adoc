:navtitle:  References

When a reference is provided in a resource and not contained in the Bundle, the engine should attempt to
GET it from the sending site. If not possible, the engine proceeds with the mapping. 

To prevent circular dependencies in FHIR, the mapping engine should either stop at a given level of references or keep track
of which ones are already resolved.
