:navtitle: When to fail a mapping

It is recommended that the engine enforces strict rules when mapping elements.
Since the mapped data is clinical data, maintaining maximum semantics and data coverage is a top priority.

For example, if we have a parent node with a `1..1` cardinality and a child node with a `1..1` cardinality,
the mapping should fail if the child is not provided.

A more tolerant approach would be to map only the parent, ensuring that at least some data is transformed.
However, since we cannot determine what data is missing, either all data should be mapped,
or the mapping should fail.
