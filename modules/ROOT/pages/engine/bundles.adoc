:navtitle: Bundles

FHIR data is typically sent in Bundles and contains references.
These references must be processed in a specific way.

== Bundles

Bundles contain a collection of resources.
The FHIRconnect engine needs to split these Bundles into smaller collections to process them.

The context mapping files contain a list of profile URLs.
Using this list, the engine must divide the Bundle into manageable parts.

In this example, two context files are provided: one for Diagnoses and one for Procedures.
The engine splits the Bundle into two separate ones for processing.

Sometimes, resources are contained within a mapping but are also related to another mapping.

For example, the Encounter in the diagram could be mapped to an Encounter in openEHR,
but it is also referenced by Diagnose A.

For such cases, **linked mappings** are used.
See xref:types-of-mappings/concept-mappings.adoc[].

In this case, the Diagnosis mapping would link to the Encounter mapping.
As a result, in addition to processing its own mapping, the Diagnosis mapping
would also trigger the Encounter mapping.
