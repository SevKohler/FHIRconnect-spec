:navtitle: Data mapping types

##TODO annoying chapter, since we have to nail down how what is mapped, which is draining. have to do next week ##


Data mapping types are not mandatory in FHIRconnect, since the corresponding mapping is resolved by the
types contained in the serialized FHIR instances and openEHR compositions.

This chapter is mainly used to describe how these mappings are to be processed.

== NONE
Does nothing, usually used to access nested elements of the path, in the child mapping methods.

##I think we also maybe talk about dynamics typing or is this we leave up to the engine how it is processing the order
and prioritizing it. ##



##These are the ones we have to adress, at least in the spec (the library should contain which ones are not supported)

Maybe we should list this as it should be transformed by data types:
