:navtitle: Hierarchy Mappings


Hierarchy mappings are the most complex type of mappings.
Sometimes, the hierarchy between a FHIR and an openEHR model does not align properly.
For example, elements may exist on different levels in the models, leading to complications.

A good example of this is the FHIR `MedicationStatement`.
Without delving into the details of why the models are structured differently,
there are several challenges to address.

In FHIR, the `timing.event` contained within the `dosage` element
(see https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r4.core/4.0.1/files/80817[MedicationStatement])
maps to the `dateTime` of the `EVENT` in openEHR.
Therefore, if there are three `dosages` in FHIR with different `timing.event` values,
three separate `EVENT` elements must be created in the openEHR
https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.4949[medication_statement] archetype.

Another issue is the `route` of administration.
In openEHR, the `route` of administration is optional (0..1) for each `medication_statement` EVENT.
However, in FHIR, this is part of the `dosage` element.
A single `MedicationStatement` in FHIR can have three different `dosages`,
each with a different `route` of administration.
For each unique `route` of administration, a new `medication_statement` EVENT must be created in openEHR.

The same logic applies when mapping from openEHR to FHIR.
In openEHR, each `EVENT` can contain a different medication,
whereas in FHIR, each `MedicationStatement` resource can only describe one medication.

To summarize, if the `route` or `timing.event` appears multiple times in FHIR
with different values within the `dosage` element,
a new `EVENT` must be created in openEHR for each unique occurrence.
Similarly, if there are multiple medications in openEHR,
multiple `MedicationStatement` resources must be created in FHIR.

To enable this logic, hierarchy mappings are used.
These mappings must always be defined as the first ones in a FHIRconnect file
because they significantly impact the structure of the transformed files.
Hierarchy mappings include a `hierarchy` key at the level of the `with:` block.

This block contains two sub-blocks: one for FHIR and one for openEHR.
The `create:` key specifies the type of element to be created,
and the `path:` key indicates where this element should be created.
The `unique:` key defines the condition that triggers the creation of the new element.
The path in the `unique:` key relates to the `with:` block, e.g. in the example we want to split
the data transformation based on dosages, therefore the `with:` path relates to dosage.
This will not automatically transform the dosage and event as a normal `with:` would do.
It rather is used as an indicator explained above.
