= Hierarchy Mappings

:navtitle: Hierarchy Mappings

Hierarchy mappings are the most complex type of mappings.
Sometimes, the hierarchy between a FHIR and an openEHR model does not align properly.
For example, elements may exist on different levels in the models, leading to complications.
The hierarchy mapping is always contained in the preprocessor using the `hierarchy` key.
There can be only one hierarchy mapping; currently, we have not encountered a case where more than one is needed.

== split

The simplest `hierarchy` mapping is related to events in openEHR.
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/ehr.html#_observation_class[OBSERVATION] archetypes
in openEHR can contain a list of events.
In FHIR, these `events` are sometimes represented by a resource for each one.
Therefore, for each event in openEHR, one `resource` must be created.

The `with:` key indicates which paths are to be accessed and iterated if they are 0..n.
The `split` key can contain either `openEHR` or `fhir`.
The `create` method defines the element to create.
In the case of a `resource` or `archetype`, this type is inferred by the FHIRconnect mapping file it is included in.
The `create` method is executed for each occurrence of the correlating `with` statement.

As an example:

[source,yaml]
----
  openEhrConfig:
    archetype: openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result.v1
    revision: 1.2.5
  fhirConfig:
    structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport

preprocessor:
  hierarchy:
    with:
      fhir: "$resource"
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]"
    split:
      fhir:
        create: "resource"
----

For each occurrence of `$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]`, the `split` is executed.
Each occurrence of an event (if there is more than one) will create a new `DiagnosticReport`.

The engine's composition fields remain the same for each of these mappings.
One could imagine this process as cloning the composition with one event each, making the processing 1-to-1.

== Hierarchy and unique values

Another case for hierarchy mappings is creating a new element based on a specific filter.

A good example of this is the FHIR `MedicationStatement`.
Without delving into the details of why the models are structured differently,
there are several challenges to address.

In FHIR, the `timing.event` contained within the `dosage` element
(see https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r4.core/4.0.1/files/80817[MedicationStatement])
maps to the `time` of the https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/Release-1.1.0/data_structures.html#_event_class[EVENT] in openEHR.
Therefore, if there are three `dosages` in FHIR with different `timing.event` values,
three separate `EVENT` elements must be created in the openEHR
https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.4949[medication_statement] archetype.

Another issue is the `route` of administration.
In openEHR, the `route` of administration is contained in each `medication_statement` EVENT.
However, in FHIR, this is part of the `dosage` element.
A single `MedicationStatement` in FHIR can have three different `dosages`,
each with a different `route` of administration.
For each unique `route` of administration, a new `medication_statement` EVENT must be created in openEHR.

The same logic applies when mapping from openEHR to FHIR.
In openEHR, each `EVENT` can contain a different medication,
whereas in FHIR, each `MedicationStatement` resource can only describe one medication.
So for each openEHR `EVENT` containing a different medication, a new resource needs to be created.

The grammar enables this with the `path` and `unique` keys.
To recap, the `create:` key specifies the type of element to be created.
The `path:` key indicates where this element should be created.
This is left empty if the element is the archetype or resource itself, as in the example shown at `fhir:`.
The `unique:` key defines the condition that triggers the creation of the new element.
The path in the `unique:` key relates to the `with:` method.
For example, in the example, we want to split the data transformation based on dosages,
so the `with:` path relates to dosage.
This will not automatically transform the dosage and event as a normal `with:` would do.
It is rather used as an indicator, as explained above.

[source,yaml]
----
preprocessor:
  hierarchy:
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.dosage"
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]"
    #    type: "HIERARCHY" # Not necessary since hierarchy is a unique key for hierarchy mappings
    split:
      fhir:
        create: "resource"
        unique:
          - "data[at0003]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.medication.v2]/items[at0132]"
      openehr:
        create: "event"
        path: "$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]"
        unique:
          - "route"
          - "timing.event" # If the route value differs per dosage slice, create a new event
----

To summarize:

* From FHIR-to-openEHR, for each `dosage` with a different `route` and/or `timing.event`, create a new `EVENT` in openEHR.

* From openEHR-to-FHIR, for each event in openEHR with a different medication name (`[at0132]`), create a new `MedicationStatement` resource in FHIR.
