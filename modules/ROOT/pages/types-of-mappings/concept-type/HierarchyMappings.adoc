= Hierarchy Mappings

:navtitle: Hierarchy Mappings

Hierarchy mappings are the most complex type of mappings.
Sometimes, the hierarchy between a FHIR and an openEHR model does not align properly.
For example, elements may exist on different levels in the models, leading to complications.
The hierarchy mapping is always contained in the preprocessor using the `hierarchy` key.
There can be only one hierarchy mapping; currently, we have not encountered a case where more than one is needed.

== createOn

The simplest `hierarchy` mapping is related to events in openEHR.
Often, openEHR has several events in an `OBSERVATION`.
In FHIR, these `events` are sometimes represented by a resource for each one.
Therefore, for each event in openEHR, one `resource` must be created.

Here, the `with:` key relates to the path that is checked.
For each occurrence of `$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]`, the `createOn` is executed.
The `createOn` contains a `fhir` key, which indicates that for openEHR-to-FHIR mapping, a specific logic is to be executed.
This logic is contained in the `create` key.
The `resource` states that a new resource is to be created.

The engine's composition fields remain the same for each of these mappings.
One could imagine this process as cloning the composition with one event each, making the processing 1-to-1.

        create: "resource"

== Hierarchy and unique values

Another case for hierarchy mappings is creating a new element based on a specific filter.

A good example of this is the FHIR `MedicationStatement`.
Without delving into the details of why the models are structured differently,
there are several challenges to address.

In FHIR, the `timing.event` contained within the `dosage` element
(see https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r4.core/4.0.1/files/80817[MedicationStatement])
maps to the `time` of the https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/Release-1.1.0/data_structures.html#_event_class[EVENT] in openEHR.
Therefore, if there are three `dosages` in FHIR with different `timing.event` values,
three separate `EVENT` elements must be created in the openEHR
https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.4949[medication_statement] archetype.

Another issue is the `route` of administration.
In openEHR, the `route` of administration is optional (0..1) for each `medication_statement` EVENT.
However, in FHIR, this is part of the `dosage` element.
A single `MedicationStatement` in FHIR can have three different `dosages`,
each with a different `route` of administration.
For each unique `route` of administration, a new `medication_statement` EVENT must be created in openEHR.

The same logic applies when mapping from openEHR to FHIR.
In openEHR, each `EVENT` can contain a different medication,
whereas in FHIR, each `MedicationStatement` resource can only describe one medication.

To summarize, if the `route` or `timing.event` appears multiple times in FHIR
with different values within the `dosage` element,
a new `EVENT` must be created in openEHR for each unique occurrence.
Similarly, if there are multiple medications in openEHR,
multiple `MedicationStatement` resources must be created in FHIR.

The `create:` key specifies the type of element to be created. The `path:` key indicates
where this element should be created. This is left empty if the element is the archetype or
resource itself, as in the example shown at `fhir:`.
The `unique:` key defines the condition that triggers the creation of the new element.
The path in the `unique:` key relates to the `with:` method.

To sum this up:
From FHIR-to-openEHR, for each dosage with a different route and/or timing.event creat a new event in openEHR.
From openEHR-to-FHIR, for each event in openEHR with a different Medication name (`[at0132]`) create a
new resource in FHIR.
