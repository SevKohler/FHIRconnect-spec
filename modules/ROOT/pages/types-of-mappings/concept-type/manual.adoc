= Manual mappings
:navtitle:  Manual mappings

Sometimes paths cannot be automatically transformed, or a path must be set to a static value. For this the manual mappings
where introduced. Manual mappings are initialized using the `manual:` key which is followed by a name.
This manual mapping defines what standard the mapping applies to (openehr, fhir, or both openehr and fhir). This is followed
by a list of paths `- path:` and the value we map `- value:`. Several paths can be set at the same time.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "ISMTransition"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource" #there needs to be a mapping table
      openehr: "$archetype/ism_transition/current_state"
    manual:
      - name: "initial"
        fhir:
          - path: "status"
            value: "unknown"
        openehrCondition:
          targetRoot: "$openehrRoot"
          targetAttribute: "defining_code/code_string"
          operator: "one of"
          criteria: "524"
        openehr:
          - path: "defining_code/terminology_id/value"
            value: "openehr"
          - path: "value"
            value: "Initial"
          - path: "defining_code/code_string"
            value: "524"
        fhirCondition:
          targetRoot: "$fhirRoot"
          targetAttribute: "status"
          operator: "one of"
          criteria: "unknown"

      - name: "planned"
        fhir:
          - path: "status"
            value: "preparation"
        openehrCondition:
          targetRoot: "$openehrRoot"
          targetAttribute: "defining_code/code_string"
          operator: "one of"
          criteria: "526"
        openehr:
          - path: "defining_code/terminology_id/value"
            value: "openehr"
          - path: "value"
            value: "Planned"
          - path: "defining_code/code_string"
            value: "526"
        fhirCondition:
          targetRoot: "$fhirRoot"
          targetAttribute: "status"
          operator: "one of"
          criteria: "preparation"

----
Inside manual mapping method, paths do not overwrite each other.
Full FHIR or openEHR elements are created from all given paths. For example `defining_code/terminology_id/value` and `defining_code/code_string`
are merged together in the same data element and do not overwrite.

Another typical use case would be to hardcode, extension urls in FHIR.
[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "periodOnsetStart"  # if append name needs to be the same we are appending to
    extension: "add"
    with:
      fhir: "$fhirRoot.start.extension"
      openehr: "$archetype/items[at0001]"
      type: "CODEABLECONCEPT"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$fhirRoot.start.extension" #parent selector from jsonpath-plus its like ..
      targetAttribute: "url"
      operator: "one of"
      criteria: "[http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/lebensphase]"
    followedBy:
      mappings:
        - name: "extension"
          with:
            fhir: "$fhirRoot"
          manual:
            - name: "physicalType"
              fhir:
                - path: "url"
                  value: "http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/lebensphase"

== ConceptMaps
In general manual mappings are simple in nature, but require maintenance.
To mitigate this the use of https://build.fhir.org/conceptmap.html[FHIR ConceptMaps] is recommended.
These can be used in the FHIRconnect spec using the `conceptmap:` key, that points to the conceptMap Url.

[source,yaml]
----
mappings:
  - name: "periodOnsetStart"  # if append name needs to be the same we are appending to
    with:
      fhir: "$fhirRoot.start.extension.value"
      openehr: "$archetype/items[at0001]"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$fhirRoot.start.extension" #parent selector from jsonpath-plus its like ..
      targetAttribute: "url"
      operator: "one of"
      criteria: "http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/lebensphase"
    conceptmap: "http://url-of-the-conceptmap" # ConceptMap.url
----

The concept map can also be directly attached inside the header, this way all codes contained in the
conceptmap will be transformed using the conceptmap, if it appears in the mapping.

[source,yaml]

How FHIR Connect engine resolves this concept map and does the translation of codes is outside the domain of this
FHIR Connect specification. It is, however advised that https://build.fhir.org/terminology-service.html[FHIR Terminology Service Implementation Guide]
is followed and translation is done following the https://build.fhir.org/conceptmap-operation-translate.html[$translate] operation description.
