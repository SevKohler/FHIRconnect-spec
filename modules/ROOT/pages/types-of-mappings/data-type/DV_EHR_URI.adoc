= DV_EHR_URI

https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_types.html#_dv_ehr_uri_class[DV_EHR_URI] to https://build.fhir.org/references.html#Reference[Reference]

Relates to `linked` mappings (see xref:types-of-mappings/concept-type/concept-mappings.adoc#LinkedMappings[])

For FHIR->openEHR, the openEHR platform must resolve the composition that the `DV_EHR_URI` points to.
If it is a composition and a mapping exists for it, the mapping should be triggered, and the corresponding resource returned.
If it is a bundle, it refers to the one from which the mapping was triggered, specified by the `start:` in the context.
This resource should then be attached to the bundle and included in the `reference` string.

For openEHR->FHIR, the profile mapping is resolved, if exists, and the resulting composition is referenced in the `DV_EHR_URI` value.

If there is no mapping provided for the profile or composition, the mapping is not executed.
