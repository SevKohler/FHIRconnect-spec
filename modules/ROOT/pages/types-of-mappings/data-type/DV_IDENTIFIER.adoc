This has several problems. The `type` is a `coding` in FHIR and the `assigner` a `reference` to an
Organization. In openEHR the mapped fields are `string`. To capture some of the FHIR logic,
the `type.codings` first `code` should be transformed as described in <<types-of-mappings/data-type/CODE_PHRASE.adoc#string, Coding to String>>.
