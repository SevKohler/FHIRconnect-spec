https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-data-absent-reason.html[Data Absent reason]

Element contains a field NULL_FLAVOUR to represent missing information. FHIR does this
as extension data absent reason.


Hereby the null_flavour https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-TERM/tree/master/computable/XML[codes] of openEHR has to be mapped to the https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-data-absent-reason.html[data-absent-reason-valueset].
