[NOTE]
====
As up-to-date all the PARTY_IDENTIFIED mappings found where references between a PARTY_IDENTIFIED and non-clinical
FHIR-data (organizations etc. ). It is recommended to resolve non-clinical data
references using the demographics see
<<types-of-mappings/data-type/FHIRReference.adoc#ReferencesDemographics, FHIRReferences>>
.

When mapping from openEHR->FHIR and the demographics contains the FHIR-resource, this resource should be returned as part of the
bundle and the reference string added.
