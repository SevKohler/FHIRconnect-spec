:navtitle: Reference

FHIR typically contains a lot of references. Resources are small building blocks that reference each other
to provide a comprehensive view of the patient information. The `reference:` logic was introduced to support this.
It allows us to initialize a new resource in FHIR (or the other way around) and reference it inside the resource
we are currently mapping.

This is done with the `reference:` keyword. After this, the type of resource we want to initialize
needs to be specified in `resourceType`. After that, the mapping follows the typical syntax. The openEHR key is
always set with `openEHR: $reference`, since it's a resource initialization and no direct path mapping.
Most of the time, this comes in combination with a `slotArchetype`, as in the example below.

  - name: "specimen"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.specimen.reference"
      openehr: "$reference" # no direct path mapping, use $reference
    reference:
      resourceType: "Specimen"
      mappings:
        - name: "specimenReference"
          with:
            fhir: "$fhirRoot"
            openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]/data[at0003]/data[at0065]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.specimen.v1]"
          slotArchetype: "CLUSTER.specimen.v1"
