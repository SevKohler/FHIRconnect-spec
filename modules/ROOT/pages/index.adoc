== About FHIRconnect

FHIRconnect is a derivative of YAML. It is used to bidirectionally map openEHR and FHIR.
The goal is to create a mapping language that communities can use to transform data between these standards.

FHIRconnect aims to be both comprehensive and simple to use
while providing all necessary functions for mapping.

Beyond transformation, the specification and resulting files should also serve as documentation
on how these mappings should be performed.
Even if vendors do not implement FHIRconnect, they will still have documentation
on how data should be transformed.
This is particularly important for maintaining consistency when mapping both standards across different institutions.

The initial draft of https://github.com/better-care/fhir-connect-mapping-spec[FHIRconnect] was done by https://www.better.care[Better]
, this version is a major overhaul.

The official mapping library of FHIRconnect is maintained
https://github.com/SevKohler/FHIRconnect-mapping-lib/tree/main[here].

== Current Issues and Example Mappings

You can find current issues related to the specification in the
https://github.com/SevKohler/FHIRconnect-spec[repository] under the "Issues" tab on GitHub.

The repository also contains a library of mappings.
Currently, these include mappings for KDS, the German core dataset for research,
as well as general archetype mappings.

Please note that some templates are still being reworked.
Additionally, some of the mapped templates contain outdated and low-quality archetypes
created for Highmed eight years ago (specifically, the `org.highmed` archetypes).
We are currently in the process of refactoring these.

== Maintaining the Specification
