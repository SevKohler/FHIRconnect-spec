:navtitle: Condition

Conditions are introduced to implement an IF logic for FHIRconnect. This means that the mapping method that has
a condition is only executed if the parts in the condition are true. There are two types of conditions:
`openehrCondition` and `fhirCondition` for each corresponding standard.

Examples:
[source,yaml]
----
- name: "example"
  with:
    fhir: "$fhirRoot"
    openehr: "$archetype"
  slotArchetype: "EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.v1"
  openehrCondition:
    targetRoot: "$archetype"
    targetAttribute: "data[at0001]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.problem_qualifier.v2]/items[at0063]/defining_code/code_string"
    operator: "one of"
    criteria: "at0064"
----

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "mapIdentifierForRoom"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.identifier"
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$resource.identifier"
      targetAttribute: "type.coding.code"
      operator: "one of"
      criteria: "room"
----

== targetRoot

Each condition has 4 fields. The `targetRoot` is the first one. It defines what element is returned once we
filter it. This is important since the returned element is matched against the path in the `with` method. If these do
not align, FHIRconnect won't be able to filter correctly and the engine should return an error here.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "mapIdentifierForRoom"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.identifier" # same path 0..n
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$resource.identifier" # same path 0..n
----
In the `fhirCondition` example, the `$resource.identifier` is the same in both paths. The condition is applied
to each element in the identifier (0..n), and the `with` method only executes the mapping for those identifiers for which
the condition is true.

Meanwhile, if we were to write it like the example below, the condition method would try to filter on `type`, meaning
all identifiers where type is of a certain value would be mapped.
[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "mapIdentifierForRoom"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.identifier" # same path 0..n
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$resource.identifier.type" # not the same since references type
----

== targetAttribute

The `targetAttribute` is used to specify the path the filter is applied to. The example above in FHIRPath would be
written as `$resource.identifier.where(type.coding.code="room")`, therefore checking for the code `type` and returning
the identifier entries that match. These are then the ones that are mapped in the `with:` method.
[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "mapIdentifierForRoom"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.identifier"
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$resource.identifier" # same except for type
      targetAttribute: "type.coding.code" # access child nodes
      operator: "one of"
      criteria: "room"
----

In the example below, only the `encounter-id-1245` would be mapped, since it fits the condition. The `bed` code would be
ignored.
[source,json]
----
"identifier": [
          {
            "use": "official",
            "type": {
              "coding": [
                {
                  "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
                  "code": "room" //would be mapped
                }
              ]
            },
            "system": "http://hospital.smarthealthit.org",
            "value": "encounter-id-1245"
          },
          {
            "use": "official",
            "type": {
              "coding": [
                {
                  "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
                  "code": "bed" //wouldn't be mapped
                }
              ]
            },
            "system": "http://hospital.smarthealthit.org",
            "value": "encounter-id-12asdasdasd45"
          }
        ],
----

Important is also to mention, that conditions are always applied on the input data. They do not
filter on the data that is currently mapped. When we map a FHIR resource into openEHR, only the fhirConditions are
processed and in case of openEHR to FHIR it's the other way around. So e.g. the openEHRCondition are not applied via
mapping-time to the openEHR data we are currently mapping. There can be also several Attributes used, in this case
the values need to be written as a yaml list using `-`.

Conditions can also be unattached to the path contained in the `with:` method and point to a different path.
This is sometimes necessary since there can be factors that influence the mapping in other places.
These paths are handled as simple true/false and therefore differ in the way
they interact with the `with:` method.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "room"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.location.identifier.value"
      openehr: "$archetype/data[at0001]/items[at0018]/items[at0023]"
    fhirCondition:
      targetRoot: "$resource.some.otherPath"
      targetAttribute: "coding.code"
      operator: "one of"
      criteria: "someValue"
----

== operator

Once we define on which path the condition is to be applied and how it relates (or does not relate) to the `with:` method,
we need to decide on the operator we want to apply.

|Operators |Description
|`one of` | checks if the path contains one of the elements contained in `criteria`, uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction[*OR*]

|`not of` | checks if the path does not contain one of the elements contained in `criteria`, uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction[*AND*]

|`empty` | checks if the path is empty; does not include a `criteria`, uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction[*AND*]

|`not empty` | checks if the path is not empty; does not include a `criteria`, uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction[*AND*]

|`type` | checks if the element in the path matches the given type in `criteria`, uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction[*OR*]
|===

== criteria

Defines the element that is combined with the operator and checked against the path. `criteria` is not required for
`empty` or `not empty`. `criteria` can be either a single element, or as a list (using `-`).

== Conditions in the header

There is a special case where a condition can be contained in the header of a file.
This logic defines that the mapping file is only executed if the given condition is met.

Example:
[source,yaml]
----
engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1
type: model
metadata:
  name:  CLUSTER.problem_qualifier.v2
  version: 1.0.0
spec:
  system: FHIR
  version: R4
  openEhrConfig:
    archetype: openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.problem_qualifier.v2
  fhirConfig:
    structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Condition
    condition:
       - targetRoot: "$resource.verificationStatus"
         targetAttribute: "coding"
         operator: "one of"
         criteria: "entered-in-error"
----

Here, we want the mapping into openEHR only to be executed if the `verificationStatus` of the cluster
is not `entered-in-error`. This is done to prevent wrongly entered data from being mapped into openEHR.

There can be more conditions (with AND applied between them), notice the condition being a array.
